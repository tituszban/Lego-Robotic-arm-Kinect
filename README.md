# Lego-Robotic-arm-Kinect

I built a robotic arm using LEGO, with pneumatic grabbers, that had it own pump with it's own powersource. The arm pivoted around it's base in two angles, and in one angle in the middle.

Then I built an interface for both user inputs to move the tip to relative and absolute positions, and move each pivot to a certain angle.

This interface then was compined with a different software, that took the posture of the user, and moved the tip of the arm to the same relative position as the hand was from the hip. Also, a glove with aluminium foil finger tips was used to send signals to the interface, to instruct the robot to close the grabber. This could be used to move blocks around with relative precision.
